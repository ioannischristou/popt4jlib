<body bgcolor="white">Package defines parallel/distributed versions of well-known Number Partitioning
algorithms. Number Partitioning is NP-complete and is known to exhibit a 
phase-transition when m (the number of bits of each number in the list) 
approximately equals n (the number of numbers in the list to be partitioned).

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
A multi-threaded and a distributed version of the Complete Karmarkar-Karp (CKK)
algorithm is implemented as specified by Korf (1997).
