<body bgcolor="white">Package defines interfaces and implements algorithms for graph and hyper-graph
partitioning.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The PartitionerIntf and HPartitionerIntf classes define the interfaces that 
must be implemented by any class that will implement a partitioning algorithm 
(for plain graphs or hyper-graphs, respectively).
The ObjFncIntf (and HObjFncIntf) classes define the interfaces for the 
objective function that will be minimized by any partitioning algorithm, and
the CutEdgesObjFnc class implements the most common metric in graph partitioning
namely the sum of weights of total cut-edges (the HObjFncSOED implements the 
Sum-Of-External-Degrees metric, commonly used in hyper-graph partitioning for 
VLSI CAD). The PartitionerXXX and HPartitionerXXX classes implement various 
partitioning algorithms (including heuristics inspired from the 
Fidducia-Matheyes algorithm).
