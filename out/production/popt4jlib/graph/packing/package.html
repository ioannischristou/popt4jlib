<body bgcolor="white">Optimization package that obtains near-optimal solution to the 1- and 2-packing 
combinatorial optimization problem.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Parallel solver that implements a Branch & Bound procedure embedded in a GASP
framework (Greedy Adaptive Search Procedure). Local Search is also implemented
as part of the standard GRASP procedure (as subclasses of the 
<CODE>popt4jlib.LocalSearch</CODE> package interfaces but the only neighborhoods 
that can improve upon the solution found by "GRASP without local search" are 
very time consuming procedures.
