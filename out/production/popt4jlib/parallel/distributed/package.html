<body bgcolor="white">Extends the basic functionality found in the <CODE>parallel</CODE> package over
many remote JVMs distributed over a network of machines.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The package contains algorithms for obtaining distributed locks, barriers,
Parallel-Distributed (Synchronous or Asynchronous) Task Executors, and Message 
Passing Coordinators, over standard socket mechanisms (transport layer in the 
OSI stack), without using RMI or web-services technologies. For more details, 
read the documentation for each class. Each class comes with a test-driver 
program that show-cases its intended use and effects. The whole package makes 
heavy use of the <CODE>parallel</CODE> package and its classes.
Notice that this package does not use secure socket layer communications; it
assumes that the whole network of machines that will host the package's
servers is in essentially a demilitarized zone (behind fire-walls, in 
appropriate domains etc.) Also notice that this package has several servers
that can combine to scale far beyond O/S imposed limitations on the number
of concurrent threads or sockets that a system may have open at any time,
via the use of aggregators; for example, several <CODE>DLockSrv</CODE> 
servers may combine (by pointing to another, central <CODE>DLockSrv</CODE>)
to allow for many more concurrent open lock requests than a single server
can allow. Similarly, see the design for 
<CODE>PD[Asynch]BatchTaskExecutor[Clt/Srv/Wrk]</CODE> to see how networks or
rings of servers can form, to each of which many more workers or clients may
be connected than could in any single server.
