In order to run your first example:

1. open a command-line console and type:
% cd <working_dir> 
where working_dir is the directory where you have expanded the popt4jlib.zip archive.
2. run the command:
% runDGATest testdata\dgaTridNonlinearprops3.txt
to optimize the function tests.TridNonlinearFunction in 100 dimensions using a Distributed GA.

Open the testdata\dgaTridNonlinearprops3.txt to see the parameters defined for this 
optimization run.
Other test-run .bat files are found in the top level directory, along with many different 
test configurations in the testdata directory. In general, when you run a batch file 
run<XYZ>Test.bat 
you should use a configuration file with the convention 
testdata\<xyz>SomeFunctionNameprops.txt.
