<body bgcolor="white">The graph package consists of a collection of classes for representing graphs, 
hyper-graphs and algorithms operating on such discrete finite structures

<h2>Package specification</h2>
The graph package provides a reentrant (thread-safe) Graph class that represents
directed (as well as undirected) graph objects, their nodes (Node class) and 
links (Link class) between them. It also provides an HGraph class representing
hyper-graph objects, namely graphs whose edges may connect more than 2 nodes,
and the related classes HNode and HLink.
Several algorithms are implemented that operate on Graph or HGraph objects:
1. Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm 
2. Bron-Kerbosch All Maximal Cliques finding algorithm
3. Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree algorithm
Several other algorithms will be implemented in the next version of the library
