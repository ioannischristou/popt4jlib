/**
 * Class implementing the classical notion of Semaphores as "permits".
 * A thread of computation must acquire the Semaphore before proceeding.
 * Once it is done, it releases the Semaphore.
 * This implementation, allows each Semaphore to "give out" multiple permits
 * before it forces a calling thread to wait for the prior release of one of
 * the handed-out permits.
 * It also disallows threads from "releasing" a permit they don't have.
 * The same thread may call "acquire()" as many times as it pleases without
 * incrementing the number of permits handed out. However, it must call the
 * same number of times the "release()" method in order for the permit it
 * holds to be released.
 * Note: A Semaphore with only one permit is equivalent to the atomic class
 * in this package, except that is is impossible for a thread that does not
 * have a permit to release one.
