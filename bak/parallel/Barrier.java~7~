/**
 * A class implementing the Barrier concept in parallel/distributed computing.
 * Before thread groups wishing to coordinate on barrier points can use this
 * class, a "setup" must occur either via a call to Barrier.setNumThreads(n) or
 * (recommended) Barrier.setNumThreads(groupname, numthreads). Each of the n
 * threads to "synchronize" on the barrier point then calls
 * Barrier.getInstance([groupname]).barrier();
 * The threads wait at this point until n threads actually reach this point,
 * at which time, they resume execution.
