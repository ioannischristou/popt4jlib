 * class, any tasks given as args to the orderedBarrier(task) call, will execute
 * in the order with which the threads executing them were first registered with
 * the barrier (via the addThread(thread) call).
 * Behavior is undefined if after some threads have started using the orderedBarrier()
 * call, another thread calls the addThread() method, unless a call to reset()
 * is preceded at a time when all threads have finished waiting at their last
 * barrier point.
