<body bgcolor="white">tests.sic.rnqt.nbin package: implements exact 
    and/or heuristic algorithms for the global optimization of long-run expected
    average costs of a single-echelon inventory control system operating a 
    periodic review control policy (R,nQ,T) facing stochastic demands that are
    distributed according to the Negative Binomial distribution (a compound 
    Poisson distribution where customers arrive at intervals that are spaced 
    according to the Poisson distribution, but their order quantities are 
    logarithmically distributed instead of being always single unit demands)
    in a continuous time cost-accounting setting.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The formulae for the average cost of such a system are taken from the classic IE
textbook of Hadley and Whitin, "Analysis of Inventory Systems", 1963. It is 
worth noting here that numerical integration is involved in the computation of
the back-order costs as closed form formulae are not readily available.
