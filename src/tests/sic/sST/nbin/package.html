<body bgcolor="white">tests.sic.sST.nbin package: implements exact 
    and heuristic algorithms for the global optimization of long-run exact
    average costs of a single-echelon inventory control system operating a 
    periodic review control policy (s,S,T) facing sporadic demands modeled as a
    compound Poisson process, and in particular the Negative Binomial process 
    with Poisson arrivals and Logarithmic distribution of the quantities asked, 
    with parameters &lambda; and p<sub>l</sub> in a continuous time 
    cost-accounting setting.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The formulae for the  cost of such a system are computed based on the generic
formulae in Hadley and Whitin (1963): Analysis of Inventory Systems.
