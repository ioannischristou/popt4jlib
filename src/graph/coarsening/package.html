<body bgcolor="white">package defines abstract classes and implements algorithms for coarsening graphs.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The Coarsener (for plain Graph objects) and HCoarsener (for hyper-graph HGraph 
objects) base abstract classes declare the methods that
concrete classes implementing coarsening algorithms must define. A single type
of algorithm, Edge-Based Coarsening (inspired from the Edge-Coarsening heuristic
in the h-MeTiS family of algorithms) is implemented both for graphs and for
hyper-graphs.
