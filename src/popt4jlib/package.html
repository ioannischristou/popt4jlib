<h2>Package Specification</h2>
A parallel (multi-threaded) version of a number of optimization algorithms and
meta-heuristics for optimization in Java. The algorithms implemented include:
Genetic Algorithms (island model), Simulated Annealing, Evolutionary Algorithms,
Differential Evolution, Monte-Carlo (random) Search, Particle Swarm Optimization,
Gradient-Descent methods including Steepest-Descent and Conjugate-Gradient, and
several graph-optimization algorithms including Shortest-Path problems, Weighted
Clique problems, Minimum Spanning Tree problems etc.
