    Explaining Set, an optimization problem arising in Data Mining applications.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The package implements algorithms for solving the Min. Explaining Set problem,
that is described as follows: we are given a set of variables (items) 
X = {x_0, x_1, ..., x_(M-1)} and a set of instances D = {I_0, I_1,..., I_(d-1)} 
each of which contain subsets of the vars x_i. 
There is also a set of rules S = {r_0, r_1, ..., r_(k-1)}, each of which is 
both associated with a subset of X, and with a subset of D. It is assumed 
that for each I in D, there is at least one R in S that "satisfies" (or, 
"explains") I. The problem is to find a minimum cardinality set Y of 
variables x in X, that are sufficient to "explain" all the instances in D, in
that for each I in D, there is at least one rule R in S that is associated
with I, and whose variables are all in Y. Variables, rules, and instances are
all identified by consecutive integer numbers starting at 0.
