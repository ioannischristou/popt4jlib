<body bgcolor="white">Network Flow Algorithms Parallel Implementation.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
This package contains a number of classes that implement classical (and semi-
classical) algorithms for network flow optimization problems, with an emphasis
on algorithms that are parallel in nature, and are suited for a multi-core 
shared-memory implementation. This includes algorithms that are easily 
implemented as such (e.g. Auction algorithms for the Assignment Problem), even
if their speedup is often far below ideal.
