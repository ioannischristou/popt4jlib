<body bgcolor="white">Extends the basic functionality found in the <CODE>parallel</CODE> package over
many remote JVMs distributed over a network of machines.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The package contains algorithms for obtaining distributed locks, barriers,
Parallel-Distributed Task Executors, and Message Passing Coordinators, over
standard socket mechanisms (transport layer in the OSI stack), without using
RMI or web-services technologies. For more details, read the documentation for
each class. Each class comes with a test-driver program that show-cases its
intended use and effects. The whole package makes heavy use of the 
<CODE>parallel</CODE> package and its classes.
